# 771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
-   `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
-   All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.

        counter = 0
        jewels = set(J) # search in a set is instant - O(1)
